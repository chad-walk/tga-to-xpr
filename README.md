# TGA to XPR Converter

This is a simple script to batch convert TGA image files to XPR format for use in XBOX 360 games. Within the project folder, create a directory called TGA and add all of the TGA images you want to convert. The images do not need to be the same size or alpha. The script will will create a new RDF for each image and then convert it to XPR. Currently only DXT1 and DXT5 are supported.

# Please keep a copy of your TGA images! Each image is deleted after it is converted.
